# Hangman Python Game

Welcome to the Hangman Python Game! This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word.

## Features

- **Word Selection**: Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts users to guess letters, providing feedback on each guess.
- **Hangman Display**: Visually represents the hangman's current state using ASCII art, updating with each incorrect guess.
- **Game State Management**: Tracks guessed letters, remaining attempts, and determines win/loss conditions.
- **High Scores**: Tracks and stores high scores in a JSON file.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jlchafardet/hangman-python.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd hangman-python
    ```

3. **Run the Game**:

    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```

4. **Guess Letters**: Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters and try to uncover the hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn.

# Recommendations for Improving the Hangman Python Game

To enhance your Hangman game and provide a more engaging experience for players, consider implementing the following improvements:

## 1. **Expand the Word List**

- ~~**Diverse Vocabulary**: Incorporate a larger and more diverse set of words to increase the game's challenge and replayability.~~
- **Word Categories**: Organize words into categories (e.g., animals, countries, technology) and allow players to choose a category before starting the game.
- **External Word Sources**: Utilize external APIs or word lists from online sources to dynamically fetch words, ensuring a vast and varied selection.

## 2. **Enhance Input Validation**

- **Single Letter Enforcement**: Ensure that the player inputs only single alphabetic characters. Reject multiple letters or non-alphabetic inputs with appropriate error messages.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Handle input without case sensitivity, allowing players to enter letters in either uppercase or lowercase without issues.
- **Duplicate Guess Handling**: Improve feedback for repeated guesses by providing more informative messages or hints.

## 3. **Persist Game State**

- **Save and Load Feature**: Allow players to save their current game state and resume later. This requires storing essential game data (e.g., word, guessed letters, remaining tries) in a file or database.
- ~~**High Scores**: Implement a high score tracking system that records players' best performances, encouraging competition and replayability.~~

## 4. **Develop a User Interface (UI)**

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Transition from a command-line interface to a GUI using libraries like `tkinter`, `pygame`, or `PyQt`. A GUI can provide a more interactive and visually appealing experience.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Create a web version of the game using frameworks like Flask or Django, allowing players to enjoy Hangman directly in their browsers.

## 5. **Introduce Multiplayer Mode**

- **Cooperative Play**: Allow multiple players to collaborate in guessing the word, taking turns or working together to uncover letters.
- **Competitive Play**: Implement a competitive mode where players take turns guessing letters, with each correct guess earning points or other rewards.

## 6. **Add Difficulty Levels**

- **Varying Challenges**: Introduce multiple difficulty levels (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard) that affect factors such as the length of the word, the number of allowed incorrect guesses, or the complexity of the words.
- **Timed Challenges**: Incorporate time-based challenges where players must guess the word within a certain timeframe, adding urgency to the gameplay.

## 7. **Improve Hangman Display**

- **Animated Graphics**: Enhance the visual representation of the hangman with animations that progress smoothly as the player makes incorrect guesses.
- **Color Coding**: Use colors to differentiate between correct and incorrect guesses, making the game more visually engaging and easier to follow.

## 8. **Implement a Scoring System**

- **Points Allocation**: Assign points for each correct guess and deduct points for incorrect ones. This adds a layer of strategy as players aim to maximize their scores.
- **Leaderboard**: Create a leaderboard that displays high scores, fostering a sense of competition among players.

## 9. **Refactor and Modularize Code**

- **Code Organization**: Break down the code into multiple modules or classes to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Reusability**: Encapsulate functionalities (e.g., word selection, input handling, display rendering) into separate functions or classes, promoting code reuse.

## 10. **Add Unit Tests**

- **Testing Framework**: Utilize Python's `unittest` or `pytest` frameworks to write tests that ensure each component of the game works as intended.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement continuous integration (CI) to automatically run tests whenever changes are made, ensuring the game's reliability over time.

## 11. **Enhance User Experience**

- **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for correct and incorrect guesses, enhancing the immersive experience.
- **Hints System**: Provide optional hints that players can use to reveal certain letters or get clues about the word.
- **Responsive Design**: If transitioning to a GUI or web interface, ensure that the design is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.

## 12. **Internationalization and Localization**

- **Multiple Languages**: Support multiple languages by translating the user interface and word lists, making the game accessible to a broader audience.
- **Unicode Support**: Ensure that the game correctly handles Unicode characters, allowing for words from various languages with special characters.

## 13. **Documentation and Help**

- **In-Game Instructions**: Provide clear instructions and guidance within the game to help new players understand how to play.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation for the codebase, facilitating contributions from other developers and aiding future maintenance.

## 14. **Performance Optimization**

- **Efficient Algorithms**: Review and optimize algorithms to ensure the game runs smoothly, especially when scaling up features like large word lists or multiplayer modes.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure that resources (e.g., memory, file handles) are properly managed to prevent leaks and ensure optimal performance.

Implementing these recommendations will not only improve the functionality and user experience of your Hangman game but also make the codebase more robust, maintainable, and scalable for future developments.
