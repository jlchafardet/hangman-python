# Hangman Python Game

Welcome to the Hangman Python Game! This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word.

## Features

- **Word Selection**: Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts users to guess letters, providing feedback on each guess.
- **Hangman Display**: Visually represents the hangman's current state using ASCII art, updating with each incorrect guess.
- **Game State Management**: Tracks guessed letters, remaining attempts, and determines win/loss conditions.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jlchafardet/hangman-python.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd hangman-python
    ```

3. **Run the Game**:

    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```

4. **Guess Letters**: Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters and try to uncover the hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand Word List**: Integrate a larger and more diverse set of words, possibly categorized by difficulty or theme.
- **Input Validation**: Enhance input handling to manage invalid inputs more gracefully (e.g., non-alphabetic characters, multiple letters).
- **Persist Game State**: Allow users to save and resume games.
- **User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like `tkinter` or `pygame` for a more interactive experience.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Introduce a multiplayer option where players can take turns guessing letters.
